Certainly! To check the Python version and the pip version installed on your system, you can use the following commands:

1. **Check Python Version:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python -V
   ```

   This will display the installed Python version.

   Note: In some systems, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on the installation.

2. **Check Pip Version:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   pip -V
   ```

   This will display the installed pip version.

   Note: In some systems, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on the installation.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
